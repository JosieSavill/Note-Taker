## *Description*  
<br>

As a busy student and parent of a high-school athlete, I want to be able to easiy keep track of appointments,   
as well as grocery lists, doctor visits, basketball practices, etc.  
I would like to have an online note writing and saving application where I can organize my busy schedule.  
This application would also allow me to delete notes that are no longer needed.

<br>

## *Instructions*  
<br>

Click on the Heroku link below.  

The Note-Taker homepage presents with a link to add notes.  

When the link is clicked, a page with saved notes listed on left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter new note on right.  

When both the title and body of the note are completed, a Save ikon appears in the upper right-hand corner of screen.  

When the Save ikon is clicked, then the new note appears at bottom of left-hand column.  

To the right of the saved notes, there is a Delete ikon.  

When the Delete ikon is clicked, the saved note will be deleted.  

To add a new note, the title and body field is accessible in the right-hand column.
